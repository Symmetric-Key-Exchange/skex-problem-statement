                Symmetric Key Exchange Problem Statement
              draft-aelmans-skex-problem-statement-latest

Abstract

   Asymmetric cryptography and Public-key cryptography mechanisms are
   considered to be vulnerable to quantum computer attacks, posing a
   challenge to data security and integrity.  Furthermore, there are use
   cases where asymmetric cryptography is not a good fit to solve the
   problem of key distribution, examples include computationally
   constrained devices.  This document outlines and describes the
   challenges with currently widely used Asymmetric cryptography and
   Public-key cryptography.

1.  Introduction

   The current context presents challenges for communication security on
   the Internet: * Asymmetric-key cryptography is a versatile tool for
   securing communication but it does have some shortcomings and
   limitations, including that: * It is generally computationally
   intensive * Its security relies on the complexity of solving
   mathematical problems * The arrival of the quantum era is now
   additionally jeopardizing the security of key exchanges based on
   asymmetric cryptography. * Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms
   show some promise against quantum attacks, but are unproven and *
   typically computationally intensive and require increased message
   sizes. * Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has desirable properties, but
   is unsuitable for general use on the internet. * Symmetric key
   cryptography is well-trusted, including Pre-Shared keys (PSK), though
   the key distribution presents a challenge.

   This leads to the need to address the problem of symmetric key
   establishment and standardization: * Symmetric key distribution
   mechanisms and protocols are not yet standardized. * Several
   government institutions and users of cryptography have requested
   newer and standardized methods for symmetric key distribution
   mechanisms. * System integrators and architects need to be able to
   abstract the symmetric key distribution so that their systems do not
   depend on a specific vendor. * Existing interface standards do not
   address all abstraction levels nor the range of applications.  For
   example, ETSI GS QKD 014 is a high-level protocol, unsuited to
   internal low-level APIs. * Security of key management must be
   considered in a wide range of contexts. * Systems that may be
   deployed widely must be highly scalable.
